Hello there, in this directory we will be learning data structures and algorithms by   [codebasics][0]

[0]: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeo1K3hjS3uu_n_a__MI_KktGTLYopZ12 "codebasics"
In the playlist, you will find a great tutor who has published a while ago this amazing serie of videos, where you can understand and practice each new concept in order to have more tools when approaching to problems you will find along your career.

**And, just so you know**, I will publish, and document scripts in this directory randomly. Meaning that I will not create a new script for every single video of the playlist, but for the concepts I want to learn/reinforce.
