# Hi there!

This working directory will contain information and code in regards of data structures such as *Trees, Queues, Stacks* and many more. The information would be summarys of each important concept or data structure I think we need to learn when it comes of data structures and algorithms.

###### Key note
The summaries will be created based on the ZTM course ***Master the Coding Interview: Data Structures + Algorithms***. My intention is just to write down insightful notes so anyone who is new when it comes to this topic can learn and grasp key concepts.
